## Client: Ionic

To get started with Ionic in Flock, follow these steps as needed.

1. Install NPM and Bower
2. Inside the `client` folder, run `npm install` and `bower install`
3. Install cordova and ionic globally. Run `npm install -g cordova ionic`
4. Add all platforms (inside the client folder):

For Android:
```
ionic platform add android
ionic build android
```

For iOS:
```
ionic platform add ios
ionic build ios

```

* iOS users need to run `cordova prepare` when making changes to the client before porting to real devices

5. [Port your application on real devices](http://www.neilberry.com/how-to-run-your-ionic-app-on-real-devices/)

## Server: Node & Express

To run server code locally:

```
# the server folder

npm install
grunt server-dev
```



## Challenges

- Transcoding video files. Ubuntu 14.04 doesn't come preloaded with ffmpeg
- Deployment and porting to phone
- Ionic. Modals and icons didn't work as expected for mobile without workarounds
- Navigating ionic, cordov

## Changes from v. 1.0

- POI markers now use video camera icons exclusively
- File upload handling on the server-side
- Geofencing. Videos only appear within a certain radius
- Calendar / Time Filter
- Likes
- New server endpoints for likes and videos

## Future Feature Extensions
- File encoding
- Add better support for both Android and iOS phones
- Landmarks. Add the ability to drop a pin and request videos in that location
- Clustering videos that fall within certain boundaries 
- Form Validation
